    <h1>Community Health</h1>
    <img src="hush.jpg" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>Community health is a medical specialty that focuses on the physical and mental well-being of the people in a specific geographic region. This important subsection of public health includes initiatives to help community members maintain and improve
        their health, prevent the spread of infectious diseases and prepare for natural disasters. “Working at the community level promotes healthy living, helps prevent chronic diseases and brings the greatest health benefits to the greatest number of
        people in need,” reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).1 Strong community health requires residents to look beyond themselves and take “collective responsibility,” says Caleb Backe, health and wellness expert at Maple Holistics.
        “It’s not just about the healthcare system, but focuses on the importance of leading a generally healthy lifestyle in order to protect the community as a whole.” Community health is inextricably tied to individual wellness. “Good community health
        equates to healthy people, as a community is the ecosystem or environment in which people live,” says Thomas G. Bognanno, president and CEO of Community Health Charities. “It’s difficult to be healthy personally if your community is unhealthy.”</p>
    <h1>HIV/AIDs</h1>
    <img src="making.jpg" style="width:1000px; height:500px ;">
    <p>HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, weakens your immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. Over time, HIV can destroy so many of your T-cells or CD4 cells, a key part of your immune system, that your body can’t
        fight infections and disease anymore. When this happens, HIV infection can lead to AIDS. AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a complex illness with a wide range of complications and symptoms. AIDS is the final stage of HIV. When individuals
        reach this stage, they are at high risk for opportunistic infections due to their badly damaged immune system.</p>
    <h1>Cancer</h1>

    <img src="world.png" style="height:300px;width:300px;">
    <p>Cancer is a term used to describe a disease in which abnormal cells grow out of control. There are over 100 diseases that classify as cancer. Cancer cells can invade, or grow into, other tissues and form tumors. Cancer may spread, but it is always
        named for the place where it started. For example, cancer that starts in the breast is called breast cancer. Cancer can be a complex topic for some to understand. </p>
